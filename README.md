# Analysis on Jobs Related to Data/Technology

This Dashboard provides a valuable insight into the Technology sector. It helps us to see the explore the different technology fields and whether people are happy making a job switch to that field. The visual representation of the average salary one can expect in the sector gives a new graduate student entering the field a better perspective on what to expect when considering data science or data Analysis as a job field.


## Problem Statement

This Dashboard provides a valuable insight into the Technology sector. The visual representation of the average salary one can expect in the sector gives a new graduate student entering the field a better perspective on what to expect when considering data science or data Analysis as a job field. We also look at the number of people who took the survey as well as how many people who actually made the swicth to the technology sector. 

The people with the highest average salary were Data Scientist, making about $94,000/

Also, the most common programming language that was used was Python (497 users).


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is an Excel file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor and check all the columns to make sure everything is there.
- Step 3: Do the necessary cleaning of columms. Columns that were of no value or need, can be deleted. Columns with multiple values that can be represented as one, can be done do using 'split column' and splitting based on what it is to be split.
- Step 4: Getting the average salary using the range of salary that was given so that we have an average to get an idea of what people earn.
- Step 5: Once all data pre-processing is done, we can start with making the visualizations. 
- Step 6 : Make all the visualizations based on the insights you want.
- Step 7: In this case, we wanted to know the answer to the following questions:- 
1) The most common programming language used
2) Who makes the most salary in the technology sector?
3) Are people happy making the switch to the field?
4) Where do most of the survey takers live?
5) How many people made the switch?
6) Looking at average salary by the different ages.
